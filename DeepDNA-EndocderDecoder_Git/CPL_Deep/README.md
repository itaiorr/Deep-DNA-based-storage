##CPL algorithm
![cpl_pic](cpl.png)
The CPL algorithm is implemented in c++. 
Installation of the g++ compiler is required (see link: https://gcc.gnu.org/). 


### Compilation

Compilation is highly recommended by running the makefile command. 

```bash
make
```

Alternatively, compilation can be done by running the following command. 

```bash
g++ -std=c++0x -O3 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -o *.cpp g++ -o main *.o
```
